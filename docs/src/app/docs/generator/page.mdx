# Prisma Enum Generator

It turns out Prisma doesn't treeshake very well, so your prisma client (20kB compressed) is being imported everytime you use an enum. They also cannot be imported on the client as the prisma client will throw errors there.

> See related issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/13567#issuecomment-1332030096).

That's where this generator comes in. It pulls out all your enums into a separate file which you can import without the prisma client being "leaked" in. This means you can use enums on the client in for example shared validation schemas both on the server and client, as well as reducing your overall bundle size by not allowing the prisma client to leak in to the bundle unnecessarily.

## Installation

<Steps>

### Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm add -D @prisma-enums/generator
```

### Add generator to schema.prisma

```prisma title="./schema.prisma"
generator enum {
  provider = "prisma-enums"
}
```

### Run it

```sh title
pnpm prisma generate
```

### Use it

```ts title="./enums/index.ts"
import { PaymentStatus } from '~/prisma/generated/enums';

if (payment.status === PaymentStatus.PAID) { ... }
```

</Steps>

## Configuration

### Output file

> `@default ./enums/index.ts`

You can set the `output` option to change the output directory of the generated enum file, as well as `file` to change the name of the file.

```prisma title="./schema.prisma"
generator enum {
  provider = "prisma-enums"
  output = "."
  file = "enums.ts"
}
```

The path is relative to your prisma schema, so the above would generate a file called `enums.ts` in the same directory as your `schema.prisma` file.
